- Usage
Select an audio device to record from. Make sure you choose the right one, recording from a quiet audio device will result in an empty audio file (and errors).

Choose encoding settings. All recordings are first saved as a WAV file with different specifications depending on your audio device settings. If you want to get a "normal" 44,1kHz/16bit WAV file, make sure to check the downsample checkbox.

Choose an output folder.

Click record to start recording and stop to stop recording.
